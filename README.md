Lightweight sound graph framework

## Design choices

* Will *not* contain any actual sound interface code
* Will *not* do resource management, resources lifetime etc are handled outside, resources for the graph are only pointer+size
* Will *not* support sub-graphs, the rendering engine should only work with "flat" graphs to reduce complexity. Authoring tools should handle this, just focus on designing data structures so it is easy to add/remove parts of a graph (which may be grouped in authoring tool)
* Will *not* support recursive connections - the target is not creative sound design but rather simpler game sound engine. Reduces complexity in rendering
* Pitching (by altering playback speed) is responsability of generator nodes (WAV/OGG/Procedural)
* Simple data structures - serialization should be very simple (but built outside of core)
* Small memory footprint
* Simple interface to add more node types - API should make it easy to define nodes in a shared or static library
* Straight forward rendering, since no recursive connections are allowed it is simple to determine rendering order (Authoring tools should write out the nodes in the correct rendering order)
* Design should allow for a task-basked job system to multithread the rendering - easy dependency tracking
* Simple static type/size of nodes, extra data are either parameters or resources provided by the graph
* External input and outputs (both sound and events) should be easily accessible
* External access to node parameters
* External access to node triggers
* Ideally I would like to make it a single-header library - will try to keep core small, not sure about dependencies - need hashing and hash-to-index lookup which depends on xxHash and JCash/containers currently
* Some form or node type registry will be needed but should be built outside of the core

## Third party libraries

Third party libraries are added as git submodules in the third-party folder

* containers from https://github.com/JCash/containers.git
* xxHash from https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash.git

## Building

Building is just the tests right now, no actual application.

### Windows

* Start a Visual Studio command prompt with the visual studio environment variables and path set up
* Execute 'compile_cl.bat' or 'compile_cl_debug.bat' of optimized vs un-optimized build respectively
* Output is in 'build' folder

### Linux/MacOS (clang) CURRENTLY BROKEN/INCOMPLETE/UNTESTED

* Execute 'compile_clang.bat' or 'compile_clang_debug.bat' of optimized vs un-optimized build respectively
* Output is in 'build' folder

## TODO

* Decide exactly what is part of core and what is not
  * Move hash-based lookup of parameters out of code, core uses direct addressing by node index and parameter/trigger index. Authoring tool should allow for making "public named" parameters/triggers that can be used by the runtime outside the core, lookup is name (hash) to node + index.
  This makes it easier to keep core down and remove dependencies.
* Event triggering - simple "trigger" event or something more complex?
  * Triggers need to be queued - can't have just a "trigger x was triggered n times since last render call". Order matters for triggers - start vs stop etc.
* How do we handle triggers betwen nodes? A node should be able to trigger other nodes
* Should a node be able to alter parameters of another node? Doubtful...
* How to facilitate node specific buffer allocations for things like delay/reverb? Can be frame rate dependant
* FrameRate is now set at Graph construction, not sure this is a good design choice
* Authoring tools - considering DearImGUI for this, but haven't decided yet
* Tons of node types - OGG, WAVE, Pan, Random/Sequential triggers, Mixing, Effects etc
* Named parameters should probably be global so a specific parameter in a graph has a global name set in the authoring tools - makes scripting use easier as user then only specifies graph and name instead of knowing node index (which may change when graph is modified). Not sure if this should be part of the core or added on top of current api for parameters...
  * Similar option is that in authoring tools you can name a node and then address it outside using hash of node name and hash of parameter name, add lookup from name to node index?
* Audio output base so it is possible to actually hear the results, not part of core, likely part of separate test app
* Much more that I forgot to list...
